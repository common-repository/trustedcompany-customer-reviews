**Tip**: You can ask customers for feedback at the time they order your product, or when the product is delivered. TrustedCompany recommends using delivery confirmation. You will need to go into your TrustedCompany Dashboard and adjust the delivery delay. Go to "Reviews" | "Email Template for Automatic Customer Feedback" and adjust the "Set a delay for your invitation emails" to the number of days appropriate for your client base. TrustedCompany recommends 1 day after delivery.
